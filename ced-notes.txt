1. Create the requirements file. "requirements.md"
  - ask claude to create a requirement copy pasting the raw requirements and referencing the sample-requirements.
2. Based on the requirements, ask Claude code to create CLAUDE.md
  - prompt: prompts/p1.txts
3. proceed on planning
  - change to opus
  - change to planning mode
  - prompt: prompts/p2.txt
    - Q: I think we do not need to create any detailed prompt information already since the requirements.md and CLAUDE.md has enough information already?
      - Ans: yes it is ok. it will generate the ff file "tasks/todo.md" and it is very detailed already.
4. proceed on implementation
  - switch model so that you can save cost
  - prompt: proceed working on the task mentioned in @tasks/todo.md
  - Q: Is it better to make the opus the implementer?
    - Ans: Yes and no.
      - Yes since it is the most optimize model and if you don't care about the cost then choose opus
      - No, if you are conservative on the cost and still want a quality output, sonnet is still good. However, for the planning it is important to use opus since planning the most important part.
5. Others
  - added the curl.md
    - prompt: prompts/p3.txt


## Tips
1. always commit the changes every after claude code has finish
2. if there is an issue, just copy paste it to claude code.
